# DIY_VR
this repository is for the final project of my B.Sc in computer science developing vr headset.

In this repository we implement an OpenVR driver  and the firmware ,that sends the headsets input to OpenVR.
This input will move the game character. This driver is coded to constantly send forward the HMD input to OpenVR,
causing the game character to move as we move our head and diplay the scene on the head monitor. 

we created this driver to make it easy for gamers to change the way they play. 
so if you are a gamer on low budget just download this repository and go to the our [Wiki](https://github.com/IdoGuzi/DIY_VR/wiki) to see how to create the HMD 
and what you need to create it and install this driver so you can make it work.
